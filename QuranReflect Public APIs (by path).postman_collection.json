		"description": "These APIs enables you to programatically access the [QuranReflect](http://www.quranreflect.com) platform . \n\nThe documentation (and the APIs) are a work-in-progress and are managed by a small team including volunteers. Please keep this in mind as you browser our documentation and integrate with your application. \n\nWe strive to provide an API experience that is world-class, and understand there is a long way to get there and we appreciate your feedback and comments along this journey.\n\n# How to use this documentation\n\nPlease browse the few sections in the beginning of the topic and then you can select the area youa are interestined in (i.e. User, Post).\n\nNote that the documentation will show `{{baseUrl}}` as the base API URL until you choose an `Environment` from the top-left menu. Once chosen, the environment URL will then be used for all the examples and URLs in the documentation.\n\n# Authentication\n\n### Client Auth Token\n\nIn order to use the APIs you will need to send a `client_auth_token` as part of your request. This is usually sent as part of the JSON body of your request. It is a secret key that resembles an API access key and is given to you by the QuranReflect team when you sign up to access our APIs.\n\nPlease note that this token is unique per environment, so you will need a different one for staging and production.\n\n### User Auth Token\n\nFurthermore, when sending a request to the API that requires user authentication you will need to provide a collection of items, usually via headers, to authenticate your request. You receive these items when you sign-in a user.\n\n#### Token Expiry\n\nPlease note that when you sign-in a user, along with the token information you will get back is an `expiry` header. This dictates the time your token will expire. There is currently no way to refresh a token, so when it expires you need to do another sign-in request to get a fresh token.\n\n# Environments\n\n## Dev/Staging\n\nThe URL for the dev/staging envrionment is: http://qreflect.com/v1\n\nWARNING: The dev endpoint only supports HTTP. This will be changed in the future.\n\n## Production\n\nThe URL for the dev/staging envrionment is: https://www.quranreflect.com/v1 \n\nPlease use HTTPS only to access our APIs. HTTP access will be deprecated soon.\n\nTODO: Disable HTTP on the API endpoint.\n\n# Sample Source Code\n\nYou can select a language from the `Language` menu at the top of this page. This will generate sample code for _accessing_ the APIs.\n\nWe plan to provide more sample source code that includes a complete workflow (i.e. signing in and loading posts) in a few languages, which will also include custom components built to work around a few of the APIs design limitations.\n\nTODO: Include sample implementations especiallay for search\n\n# Request API Access\n\nTo request a `client_auth_token` for API access please [email our team](mailto:support@quranreflect.com) and include the following:\n\n- Your full name and the organization you are associated with\n- How do you plan to use the APIs\n- Any specific technical details on how the APIs will be accessed (i.e. a backend, or mobile app and what platform)\n- If you require any help or guidance from our team in the implementation\n\nOur team will be in touch once they receive your request.",

I won’t repeat my mistake of setting a minimum of one juz’ per night from the start.\\r\\nDouble up: I read my wird in the morning and then recite the same verses while praying qiyam. Somehow, repeating the same verses twice a day helped me reflect and ponder on them better.\\r\\nDraw stars: Here is where the pencil magic kicks in! I drew asterisks in the margins of my mus’haf to mark the verses that touched me, whether I applied them to my own life or simply enjoyed their meaning or figurative language. The next time I read those verses, their effect on me was much deeper and reflecting on them (or sometimes just being fascinated by them) was much easier! Furthermore, whenever I reached the same page again, I would add more stars. So the page that started with having one star ended up with three or four; the verses that move my heart have now doubled at least, Alhamdulillah!\\r\\nLook for themes and patterns: Sometimes a certain surah mentions a lot of blessings, for example, or one of Allah’s Most Beautiful Names or attributes are repeated many times. I believe this is done to draw our attention to a certain theme so that we will read all the verses in the context of that theme. Sometimes I find themes for the whole surah and sometimes for a page or a group of verses.

I won’t repeat my mistake of setting a minimum of one juz’ per night from the start.\\r\\nDouble up: I read my wird in the morning and then recite the same verses while praying qiyam. Somehow, repeating the same verses twice a day helped me reflect and ponder on them better.\\r\\nDraw stars: Here is where the pencil magic kicks in! I drew asterisks in the margins of my mus’haf to mark the verses that touched me, whether I applied them to my own life or simply enjoyed their meaning or figurative language. The next time I read those verses, their effect on me was much deeper and reflecting on them (or sometimes just being fascinated by them) was much easier! Furthermore, whenever I reached the same page again, I would add more stars. So the page that started with having one star ended up with three or four; the verses that move my heart have now doubled at least, Alhamdulillah!\\r\\nLook for themes and patterns: Sometimes a certain surah mentions a lot of blessings, for example, or one of Allah’s Most Beautiful Names or attributes are repeated many times. I believe this is done to draw our attention to a certain theme so that we will read all the verses in the context of that theme. Sometimes I find themes for the whole surah and sometimes for a page or a group of verses. Whatever it is, I note it down (blessings, Ash-Shakur, etc) in one or two words in the upper margin of the page.\",\n                \"likes\": 2,\n                \"draft\": false,\n                \"published_at\": \"May 30, 2018 13:17\",\n                \"room_id\": null,\n                \"global\": true,\n                \"editable\": false,\n                \"deletable\": false,\n                \"reportable\": null,\n                \"citation_texts\": {\n                    \"0\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 18716,\n                            \"citation_id\": 3,\n                            \"number\": 1,\n                            \"text\": \"Alif, Lam, Meem.\",\n                            \"translation_id\": 5\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 18717,\n                            \"citation_id\": 3,\n                            \"number\": 2,\n                            \"text\": \"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah -\",\n                            \"translation_id\": 5\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 18718,\n                            \"citation_id\": 3,\n                            \"number\": 3,\n                            \"text\": \"Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,\",\n                            \"translation_id\": 5\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 18719,\n                            \"citation_id\": 3,\n                            \"number\": 4,\n                            \"text\": \"And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].\",\n                            \"translation_id\": 5\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 18720,\n                            \"citation_id\": 3,\n                            \"number\": 5,\n                            \"text\": \"Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.\",\n                            \"translation_id\": 5\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 18721,\n                            \"citation_id\": 3,\n                            \"number\": 6,\n                            \"text\": \"Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.\",\n                            \"translation_id\": 5\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 18722,\n                            \"citation_id\": 3,\n                            \"number\": 7,\n                            \"text\": \"Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil.

I won’t repeat my mistake of setting a minimum of one juz’ per night from the start.\\r\\nDouble up: I read my wird in the morning and then recite the same verses while praying qiyam. Somehow, repeating the same verses twice a day helped me reflect and ponder on them better.\\r\\nDraw stars: Here is where the pencil magic kicks in! I drew asterisks in the margins of my mus’haf to mark the verses that touched me, whether I applied them to my own life or simply enjoyed their meaning or figurative language. The next time I read those verses, their effect on me was much deeper and reflecting on them (or sometimes just being fascinated by them) was much easier! Furthermore, whenever I reached the same page again, I would add more stars. So the page that started with having one star ended up with three or four; the verses that move my heart have now doubled at least, Alhamdulillah!\\r\\nLook for themes and patterns: Sometimes a certain surah mentions a lot of blessings, for example, or one of Allah’s Most Beautiful Names or attributes are repeated many times. I believe this is done to draw our attention to a certain theme so that we will read all the verses in the context of that theme. Sometimes I find themes for the whole surah and sometimes for a page or a group of verses.
